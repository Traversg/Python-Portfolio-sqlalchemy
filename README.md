# portfolio-sqlalchemy

This site displays all of my past Treehouse Python projects 
as well as personal information about myself.

To run all of the files in your locally, you will need to install
Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy in your terminal. Run app.py in your
terminal then copy and paste the http address in your browswer.

Over the course of this Treehouse program, I have learned how to run simple
programs with loops, conditional branching, exception handling, lists, and dictionaries
as well as accessing and manipulating databases with SQL, SQLAlchemy, and CSVs.
